Notes from initial analysis of Barunba:

Text is only shown at the beginning of each level; the levels are:
- Float Island Area
- Lake Area
- Mountain Area
- Cave Area
- Fortress Area


These names are displayed as sprites based on hiragana letters.
The hiragana are loaded into VRAM, directly from the ROM (uncompressed)

Float Area sprites are loaded into SAT at $02:$A38D and surrounding code
It seems to reference a table at roughly $0E:$44F4 to load the sprites:

Floating Island Area: (Lv 1)
---------------------
-> $44F3 (0x1C4F3) = 0C = 12 sprites
$44F8 (0x1C4F8) = 10 03 (fu)
$44FE (0x1C4FE) = 12 03 (ro)
$4504 (0x1C504) = 30 03 (-)
$450A (0x1C50A) = 32 03 (to)
$4510 (0x1C510) = 50 03 (a)
$4516 (0x1C516) = 52 03 (i)
$451C (0x1C51C) = 70 03 (ra)
$4522 (0x1C522) = 72 03 (n)
$4528 (0x1C528) = 14 03 (do)
$452E (0x1C52E) = 16 03 (e)
$4534 (0x1C534) = 34 03 (ri)
$453A (0x1C53A) = 50 03 (a)

Lake Area: (Lv 2)
----------
-> $453D (0x1C53D) = 06 = 6 sprites
$4542 (0x1C542) = 36 03 (re)
$4548 (0x1C548) = 52 03 (i)
$454E (0x1C54E) = 54 03 (ku)
$4554 (0x1C554) = 16 03 (e)
$455A (0x1C55A) = 34 03 (ri)
$4560 (0x1C560) = 50 03 (a)

Mountain Area: (Lv 3)
--------------
-> $4563 (0x1C563) = 08 = 8 sprites
$4568 (0x1C568) = 56 03 (ma)
$456E (0x1C56E) = 74 03 (u)
$4574 (0x1C574) = 72 03 (n)
$457A (0x1C57A) = 76 03 (te)
$4580 (0x1C580) = 72 03 (n)
$4586 (0x1C586) = 16 03 (e)
$458C (0x1C58C) = 34 03 (ri)
$4592 (0x1C592) = 50 03 (a)


Fortress Area: (Lv 5)
--------------
-> $4595 (0x1C595) = 09 = 9 sprites
$459A (0x1C59A) = 10 03 (fu)
$45A0 (0x1C5A0) = 38 03 (xo)
$45A6 (0x1C5A6) = 30 03 (-)
$45AC (0x1C5AC) = 32 03 (to)
$45B2 (0x1C5B2) = 36 03 (re)
$45B8 (0x1C5B8) = 3A 03 (su)
$45BE (0x1C5BE) = 16 03 (e)
$45C4 (0x1C5C4) = 34 03 (ri)
$45CA (0x1C5CA) = 50 03 (a)

Cave Area: (Lv 4)
----------
-> $45CD (0x1C5CD) = 07 = 7 sprites
$45D2 (0x1C5D2) = 18 03 (ke)
$45D8 (0x1C5D8) = 52 03 (i)
$45DE (0x1C5DE) = 10 03 (fu)
$45E4 (0x1C5E4) = 1A 03 (")
$45EA (0x1C5EA) = 16 03 (e)
$45F0 (0x1C5F0) = 34 03 (ri)
$45F6 (0x1C5F6) = 50 03 (a)

Pointers to beginnings of these blocks seem to be at:
$41F6 (0x1C1F6) = F2 44 (Float Island)
$41F8 (0x1C1F8) = 3C 45 (Lake)
$41FA (0x1C1FA) = 62 45 (Mountain)
$41FC (0x1C1FC) = CC 45 (Cave)
$41FE (0x1C1FE) = 94 45 (Fortress)


If this table needs more space, or needs to be relocated, this Bank has
about 5KB free (yes, over half !)


If we use the above English translations, 16 letters will be needed:
