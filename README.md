# PCE_xlate_Barunba
This repository holds the information used during the creation of the translation
patch for the PC Engine game Barunba

## About the Game

Barunba was a game released on the PC Engine console, as a HuCard.
It's a shooter, which allows the gun turrets to be rotated 360 degrees, through 5 levels of
challenging action.


## About the Translation

The names for "Areas" (levels of play) were the only items which required translation, and
although they needed a grraphical treatment, this was able to be performed quite quickly.

## About the Repository

This contains all the materials created/needed during the translation.
 - There is a Mednafen cheat entry, which was used in order to get through the game
for test purposes.

 - 'tools' contains all the source code and the required executables in order to reimplant
 - 'extract' contains the batch file used to extract all the ASCII art objects used for initial reference (in conjunction with 'xlate')
 - 'reinsert' contains all of the remaining batch files and translated art assets needed to reinsert.

A few technical notes can be found in the "Notes.txt" file in this folder.

## About the Team

The work broke down roughly as follows:

**Dave Shadoff:**
 - Identfication/Extraction of items to be translated
 - Tool Creation
 - Translation

**Diogo Ribeiro:**
 - Fonts
 - Testing

We all hope that you enjoy the translation.
